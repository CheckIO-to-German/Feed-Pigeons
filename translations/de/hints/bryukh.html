        I have no idea how to start solving this mission

    <div class="answer">
        This mission can be solved using various methods. The easiest is perhaps using simple modeling. Create a counter and use a while loop.
<pre class="brush: python">
minute = 0
fed_pigeons = 0
pigeons = 0
while true:
    minute += 1
    old_pigeons = pigeons
    pigeons += minute
</pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I need some help to proceed with the mission
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        If for the current step we don't have enough food, then count how many new pigeons we can feed and break the loop. Breaking the loop is very important!
<pre class="brush: python">
    if food < pigeons:
        remains_food = food - old_pigeons
        if remains_food > 0:
            fed_pigeons += remains_food
        break
</pre>
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I am gone half way through. Need help!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Else, continue feeding.
<pre class="brush: python">
food -= pigeons
fed_pigeons += minute
</pre>
    </div>

        I am stuck. I need a small hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        After the loop is broken, you return the result. To solve this mission, simply use each of
        the concepts outlined in the previous hints. Of course, if you want to better you can always
        make your code shorter.
